# Welcome!
App made using 
```bash 
create-typescript-starter
```
## For npm users

To make the app npm usable, delete the `yarn.lock` file and run in prompt `npm install`

To run the app in development mode run `npm run dev` and for production mode run `npm start`

## For yarn users

Just run `yarn dev` for development mode. For production mode run `yarn start`.


Thanks for using my backend typescript boilerplate.
